FastAPI-icontract is a `FastAPI`_ extension for design-by-contract which leverages
`icontract`_ to allow you to specify and enforce code contracts in your
`FastAPI endpoints`_.

.. _FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
.. _icontract: https://github.com/Parquery/icontract
.. _FastAPI endpoints: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/

Depending on how you set it up, FastAPI-icontract will:

* automatically **enforce** the contracts during testing or in production,
* automatically add the contracts to your **OpenAPI specification**, and
* render the **Swagger UI** with a specialized contracts plugin for nicer visualization.

Benefits of Adding Contracts to Your API
========================================

Enforcing code contracts in your FastAPI development opens up new venues for approaches
to more `systematic design`_ at the API level:

.. _systematic design: https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/227928-why-not-program-right/fulltext

* Contracts are an important **part of the specification**.

  Unlike human language, contracts written in code are unambiguous.
* Contracts are **automatically verifiable**.

  Your clients can rest assured that you actually run them.
  FastAPI-icontract will specify precisely which contracts are run in production and
  which were only verified during testing.
* Contracts provide **deeper testing**.

  If you have a mesh of microservices that you need to test in conjunction,
  turn on all the contracts and test against your *client's* data instead of your own
  limited unit test data.
* Contracts specified in code allow for automatic **client-side** verification.

  Thus you can signal formally to the client up-front what you expect
  (using pre-conditions), while the client can verify what to expect back from you
  (using post-conditions).
* Contracts are **not just for input validation**.

  Though you can use contracts for input validation as well, FastAPI already allows you
  to specify how you want your `input verified`_.
  Contracts, on the other hand, really shine when you want to specify relations
  *between* the endpoints.
* Contracts allow for **automatic test generation**.

  Tools for property-based testing such as `Schemathesis`_ can automatically generate
  test data and verify that your API works as expected.
  Post-conditions are an easy way to define your properties to be tested.

  There is an ongoing discussion with the authors of the `Schemathesis`_ how to
  integrate it with tools which generate data based on contracts such as
  `icontract-hypothesis`_.
* Contracts open up **a wider ecosystem for analysis**.

  When you decorate the endpoints with contracts, you can immediately use analysis
  tools such as `CrossHair`_ to analyze your code and find bugs.

  (Though this only makes sense for really stateless, purely functional endpoints.)
